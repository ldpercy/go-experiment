IO, FS and OS
=============


I'm still not sure which of these to use in what circumstances....
I think for things I'm interested in I should probably start with OS

OS - operating system
---------------------


https://pkg.go.dev/os


IO
---

https://pkg.go.dev/io

>	Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives. Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives, such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
>
>	Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not assume they are safe for parallel execution.

## FS - file system
-------------------

https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs

> basic interfaces to a file system


## ioutil - deprecated
https://pkg.go.dev/io/ioutil
